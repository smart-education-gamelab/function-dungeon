    question: A 60-gallon tank is initially full of water and being drained at a
      constant rate of 9 gallons per minute. Write a formula that models the number
      of gallons of water in the tank after x minutes.
    correct: y=9x+60
    wrong1: y=(1/9)x+60
    wrong2: y=-9x+60
    wrong3: None of them
    feedback: y=9x+60 is correct because the rate of change is 9 and the y-intercept
      is 60 (at x=0 minutes there was y=60 gallon water).
