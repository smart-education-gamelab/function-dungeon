  question: A 60-gallon tank is initially full of water and being drained at a constant
    rate of 9 gallons per minute. Write a formula that models the number of gallons
    of water in the tank after x minutes.
  image: {fileID: 0}
  correct: y=9x+60
  wrong1: y=(1/9)x+60
  wrong2: y=-9x+60
  wrong3: None of them
  section: 3.5
  variation: 6
  learningGoal: G5
  feedback: y=9x+60 is correct because the rate of change is 9 and the y-intercept
    is 60 (at x=0 minutes there was y=60 gallon water).
