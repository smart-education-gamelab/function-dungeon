  question: How do the lines of the equations y=3x-8 and 2y-6x+16=0 are related to
    each other?
  image: {fileID: 0}
  correct: The same line
  wrong1: The same line
  wrong2: Perpendicular lines
  wrong3: 'Lines that are neither parallel nor perpendicular '
  section: 3.1
  variation: 15
  learningGoal: G4
  feedback: 'The lines are the same. The equation 2y-6x+16=0 can be written as 2y=6x-16.
    Divide both sides by 2 and you get y=3x-8 '
