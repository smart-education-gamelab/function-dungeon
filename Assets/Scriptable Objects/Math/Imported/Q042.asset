  question: What is the missing value in the table?
  image: {fileID: 0}
  correct: -1
  wrong1: -2
  wrong2: 0
  wrong3: 1
  section: x
  variation: 5
  learningGoal: G1
  feedback: Value -1 is correct. The rate of change is constant and equal to 3 (diference
    between the y-values -4 and -7 divided by the difference between the correspondent
    x-values -1 and -2). To calculate the y-value for x=0 you add 3 to the y-value
    for x=-1. That is -4+3=-1.
