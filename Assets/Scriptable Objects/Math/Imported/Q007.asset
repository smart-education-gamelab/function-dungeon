  correct: 16
  wrong1: 14
  wrong2: 18
  wrong3: None of them
  section: 1.1
  variation: 5
  learningGoal: G1
  feedback: Value 16 is correct. The rate of change is constant and equal to 3 (diference
    between the y-values -2 and -11 divided by the difference between the correspondent
    x-values 1 and -4). The difference between the x-values 5 and -1 is 6 and because
    the rate is 3 you know that the difference between their correspondent y-values
    must be 3 times their difference (3x6=18). To calculate the y-value for x=5 you
    add 18 to the y-value for x=-1. That is -2+18=16.
