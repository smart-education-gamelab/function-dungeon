    question: "\"What is the equation of the line: parallel to the line y = -\xBCx
      + 5 and passing through the point (2, -1)?\""
    correct: "y = -\xBCx \u2212 \xBD"
    wrong1: "y = \xBCx \u2212 1\xBD"
    wrong2: "y = 4x \u2212 9"
    wrong3: "y = -\xBCx \u2212 1\xBD"
    feedback: "y = -\xBCx \u2212 \xBD is correct. The slope is -\xBC because they
      are parallel. The y-intercept is - \xBD because the line goes through (2,-1)
      and -1/4 x 2 - 1/2=-1"
