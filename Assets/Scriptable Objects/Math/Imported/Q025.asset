  question: "What is the equation of the line: parallel to the line y = -\xBCx +
    5 and passing through the point (2, -1)?"
  image: {fileID: 0}
  correct: "y = -\xBCx \u2212 \xBD"
  wrong1: "y = \xBCx \u2212 1\xBD"
  wrong2: "y = 4x \u2212 9"
  wrong3: "y = -\xBCx \u2212 1\xBD"

  feedback: "y = -\xBCx \u2212 \xBD is correct. The slope is -\xBC because they are
    parallel. The y-intercept is - \xBD because the line goes through (2,-1) and
    -1/4 x 2 - 1/2=-1"
