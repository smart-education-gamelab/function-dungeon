    question: What is the missing value in the table?
    correct: 3
    wrong1: 4
    wrong2: 5
    wrong3: 6
    feedback: Value 3 is correct. The rate of change is constante and equal to 2
      (diference between the y-values 1 and -1 divided by the difference between
      the correspondent x-values -1 and -2). To calculate the y-value for x=0 you
      add the rate 2 to the y-value for x=-1. That is 1+2=3.
