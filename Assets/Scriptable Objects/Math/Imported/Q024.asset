  question: "What is the equation of the line: perpendicular to the line y = \xBDx
    - 7 and passing through the point (3, -4)?"
  image: {fileID: 0}
  correct: y = -2x + 2
  wrong1: "y = \xBDx \u2212 5\xBD"
  wrong2: "y = 2x \u2212 10"
  wrong3: "y = -2x \u2212 5"

  variation: 17
  learningGoal: G3
  feedback: y = -2x + 2 is correct. The slope is -2 (-1/0,5= -2) because they are
    perpendicular. The y-intercept is 2 because the line goes through (3,-4) and
    -2x3+2=-4
