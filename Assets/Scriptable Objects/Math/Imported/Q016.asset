    question: Given the formulas y=ax and y=ax+5 for a certain number a. How do their
      slopes compare to each other?
    correct: They have the same steep
    wrong1: they have the same steep but different magnitude
    wrong2: they have different steep and equal magnitude
    wrong3: They have different steep and magnitude
    feedback: They have the same slope because both formulas have 'a' before the
      x.
