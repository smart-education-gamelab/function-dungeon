# Function Dungeon - Level Generator

Welcome to the **AI-Driven Level Generator Branch** of the Function Dungeon repository. This branch encapsulates the research and development efforts led by Erwin van Crasbeek, a Master's student in Applied Artificial Intelligence at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. The project represents a collaborative effort between the Smart Education Lab, Faculty of Education, and the game design team to enhance the Function Dungeon game using AI-driven procedural content generation (PCG) techniques.
