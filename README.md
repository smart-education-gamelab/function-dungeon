# Function Dungeon - Original Version by Kevin Hooijschuur

Welcome to the original version of Function Dungeon, created by Kevin Hooijschuur. This branch preserves the initial version of Function Dungeon as it was first envisioned and created.

### Note
This version has now been replaced by the more recent and updated GAMMA version. However, this branch remains as an archive and a tribute to the game's origins.
